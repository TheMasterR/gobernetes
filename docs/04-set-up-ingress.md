# Ingress
* Read [Bare-metal considerations¬∂](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/baremetal/)
* Example of exposing service with ingress:
	* `k apply -f go-ws/ingress.yml` (Ingress resource)
	* `k apply -f ingress/mandatory.yaml` (Ingress controller + ConfigMaps + Roles‚Ä¶)
	* `k apply -f ingress/nginx-service.yml` (Nginx NodePort Service)
    * Add `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"` to Ingress if TLS is not enabled ‚ö†Ô∏è 
* If consider  something in front of NodePort services look at [using a self provisioned edge](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/baremetal/#using-a-self-provisioned-edge)
* Ingresses [comparison](https://kubedex.com/ingress/)

## TLS ingress termination with cert-manager
* For [jetstack/cert-manager](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) .yml file I used [cert-manager-no-webhook](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/deploy/manifests/cert-manager-no-webhook.yaml)  file generated automatically on github based on official helm chart
* Check what means when ‚Äòwebhook‚Äô is enabled?
* Because of strict [rate-limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) we will start with the Let‚Äôs Encrypt **staging** issuer.
* For example prod limits are 5 failures per hostname per hour (prod is 60 failures per hostname per hour) 

1. `k apply -f issuer/` you can apply multiple issuers to be ready
2. Make sure the IAM user with that access/secret key combination has this specific JSON [policy](http://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/reference/issuers/acme/dns01/route53.html)
3. Create secret_key file with secret key for accessing AWS resources; than: `k create secret generic route53 --from-file=secret_key -n cert-manager` ‚Ä¶ (or use ./create_secrets.sh script)
4. `k apply -f cert-manager.yml` or with helm you can:  `helm install --name cert-manager --namespace cert-manager stable/cert-manager`
5. Create ingress resources that supports TLS
6. There are two primary ways to do TLS termination in ingress: 
	1. Add [ingress-shim](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/ingress-shim.html#how-it-works) annotations to each ingress. Then we need only ClusterIssuer resource without Certificate resources ‚úÖ
	2. Other way is creating Certificate resources in same namespace as ingress
7. When you create cert-manager pod it will watch all ingresses annotations if some of them needs new TLS secret to be created. [1st way üëÜ]
8. Wait few minutes (5+) for certificates to be ready. (look at events with `-w` in certificate namespace) or read logs of cert-manager
9. As a conclusion we need ‚Äòkubernetes.io/tls' secret per TLS ingress and per different issuer (staging/prod)
10. PS. (maybe you will need to refresh Ingress for triggering cert-manager)

## Changing TLS key for ingress / Change issuer for creation of new one
* In ingress resource change `tls.secretName` 
* If there is no key in kubernetes secrets then new one will be created by the cert-manager using the issuer **defined in certmanager.k8s.io/cluster-issuer SHIM annotation** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Using Traefik as Ingress Controller with TLS termination
* `k create configmap traefik-conf --from-file=ingress-controller-traefik/deployment_tls_ready/traefik.toml -n traefik` if you want to include .toml into traefik pod ‚ö†Ô∏è
* Use `ingress-controller-traefik/deployment_tls_ready` manifests
* Consider ‚ÄúRollingUpdate‚Äù when using traefik DaemonSet

## Setting basic auth for ingress
* `sudo yum install httpd-tools`
* `htpasswd -c ./basic_auth aracki`
* `k create secret generic traefik-ui-basic-auth --from-file basic_auth -n traefik`
* `rm basic_auth`
* Add proper annotations to ingress resource
